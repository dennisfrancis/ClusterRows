0. ~~New contrived 3 cluster dataset on 'make deployrun' with non-diagonal covariances.~~
1. Allow user to choose between diagonal vs full GMM clustering.
2. Introduce K-means clustering.
3. Allow user to pre-initialize cluster centers using
    a. random selection of c data points or means of groups.
    b. using K-means algorithm.
4. Ability to generate a chart from a dataset and labels independent from the GMMCluster formula or Clustering dialog.
5. ~~Improve notebook bar integration. (Currently no icon for ClusterRows?)~~
6. Test GMM using more contrived datasets - centers far away from origin, out of scale dimensions.
