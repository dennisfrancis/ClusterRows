ClusterRows is a libreoffice calc extension that clusters the rows in a table and colors them to indicate the clusters. The number of clusters can be chosen by the user, but the user can also let the extension auto estimate the "right number" of clusters according to Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). As of now the extension uses full expectation-maximization algorithm to compute the clusters. This extension does not depend on any machine learning or linear algebra library.
