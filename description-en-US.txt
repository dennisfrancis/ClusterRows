A LibreOffice Calc extension that clusters the rows in a table
 and color them to indicate the clusters. The number of clusters
 can be chosen by the user, but can also let the extension auto
 estimate the "right number" of clusters using Bayesian
 Information Criterion (BIC). As of now the extension uses a
 form of Expectation Maximization algorithm to compute the
 clusters. Whole of the extension was written from scratch
 and it does not depend on any Machine Learning or
 Linear Algebra library. The complete source code is made
 available under GPL3 license at
 https://github.com/dennisfrancis/ClusterRows.
 A fair amount of documentation on how to use the extension
 is also available at
